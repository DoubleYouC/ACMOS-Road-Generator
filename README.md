# ACMOS-Road-Generator
ACMOS Road Generator for A Clear Map of Skyrim and Other Worlds

This tool adds the roads using the png files in the "roads" directory to overlay onto the terrain LOD for Skyrim Special Edition.

Requires Python 3 with Pillow. I use version 3.8 to compile to ensure compatibility with Windows 7, but it can be compiled and used with the latest version.

Also requires texconv.exe from DirectXTex: https://github.com/microsoft/DirectXTex. It should be placed in subfolder called texconv, or modify code to point to your custom path.
